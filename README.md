# orbit_traj
Fortran code to model a projectile trajectory with RK4 method

As of now, orbit_adv.f95 contains the most recent code to model a projectile/satellite orbiting a planet. Running the code outputs a few .dat files, containing the tajectory of the object in 3d space, 2d space, and its potential and kinetic energy through time. It is simple to get more data from the model, as is would entail writing the desired value (height, velocity, etc.) to another file.

More information contained in comments in the code.
